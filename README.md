##Unofficial (has nothing to do with Whatsapp or Facebook) Chrome extension that put an Icon to launch Whatsapp for Web.

Usage:
- Clicking the button will open a new tab with Whatsapp for web (https://web.whatsapp.com/)
- If the tab is already opened, it will focus to it.

Just something I created to avoid typing or bookmarking the URL over and over.
